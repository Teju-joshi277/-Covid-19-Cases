Analysis on daily Covid-19 cases daily reports in united states

The subject of this project is a pandemic that has radically altered our lives. It has changed how or whether we work, how we communicate with friends, where we shop for groceries and clothes, and what we do for recreation. The economic implications have been staggering with unprecedented unemployment and cataclysmic fall in GDP. Small businesses have struggled to keep up with many shuttering for good. Large corporations in industries such as retail (e.g., Macy’s), travel (e.g., Delta Airlines) and leisure and entertainment (e.g., AMC, Disney) have witnessed sharp fall in profits. But, it hasn’t been all doom and gloom as some businesses that support a work-from-home economy such as Zoom, Docusign, Amazon, and Netflix have enjoyed huge gains.

The goal of this project is to put together a Dashboard that reflects the spread of the disease across the united states.
